# Deep Compressed Imaging via Single-Pixel Pattern Scanning
#### The need for high-speed imaging in applications such as biomedicine, surveillance and consumer electronics has called for new developments of imaging systems. While the industrial effort continuously pushes the advance of silicon focal plane array image sensors, imaging through a single-pixel detector has gained significant interests thanks to the development of computational algorithms. Here, we present a new imaging modality, Deep Compressed Imaging via Optimized-Pattern Scanning (DeCIOPS), which can significantly increase the acquisition speed for a single-detector-based imaging system. We project and scan an illumination pattern across the object and collect the sampling signal with a single-pixel detector. We develop an innovative end-to-end optimized auto-encoder, using a deep neural network and compressed sensing algorithm, to optimize the illumination pattern, which allows us to reconstruct faithfully the image from a small number of samples, and with a high frame rate. Compared with the conventional switching-mask based single-pixel camera and point scanning imaging systems, our method achieves a much higher imaging speed, while retaining a similar imaging quality. We experimentally validated this imaging modality in the settings of both continuous-wave (CW) illumination and pulsed light illumination and showed high-quality image reconstructions with a high compressed sampling rate. This new compressed sensing modality could be widely applied in different imaging systems,enabling new applications which require high imaging speed.
